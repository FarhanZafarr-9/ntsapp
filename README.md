## What's Different in This Fork

This fork builds on the solid foundation of the original Note Safe app and completely modernizes the experience:

### Overview of Enhancements
*   **Material 3 & Material You** — Implements dynamic color engines that seamlessly adapt to your system palette (Android 12+), fully transforming all UI components, dialogs, and panels.
*   **Refined Chat UI** — Overhauled the conversation view featuring asymmetric message bubbles, dynamic width constraints, dedicated swipe-to-reveal exact timestamps, and day-based visual grouping (`Today`, `Yesterday`).
*   **Intelligent Media Viewer** — Re-engineered standard viewers to automatically scale exceptionally wide panoramas and tall screenshots, enabling natural scrolling and edge-to-edge boundary tracking with 10.0x pinch-to-zoom limits and native *Save to Downloads* functionality.
*   **Advanced Formatting** — Restyled embedded location, contact, audio, and file widgets with sleek tonal backgrounds, circular borders, and contextual padding algorithms.
*   **Enhanced Security Layers** — Integrated a highly robust generic "Privacy Shield" locking state covering background modes and biometric-gated authentication setups that properly restore active screen matrices on unlock.
*   **Sleek Menus & Settings** — Standardized floating popup menus and completely refactored the settings layouts into deeply integrated Material 3 list tiles featuring inline high-precision color-picker dialogs.

### Differences at a Glance

## About Note Safe

Note Safe is a secure, open-source note-taking application designed for privacy and reliability. Built with a local-first approach, it works fully offline and lets you backup and restore your data at any time. Note Safe supports all types of multimedia notes with seamless cloud sync for effortless cross-device access.

What makes Note Safe truly special is its strong cryptographic security, powered by Libsodium APIs — a widely respected, modern, and high-performance encryption library. Libsodium provides end-to-end encryption, meaning only you can access your data, and no one — not even the cloud provider — can decrypt your notes.
